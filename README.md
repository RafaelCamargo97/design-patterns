## Design Patterns
This Kotlin project aims to demonstrate and practice the implementation of various design patterns.

## Introduction
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured approach to solving specific challenges in software development. In this project, we explore several design patterns and showcase their usage in Kotlin.

## Patterns
The following design patterns are utilized in this project:

***`Builder:`*** Simplifies the creation of complex objects by separating the construction process from the actual representation.

***`Prototype:`*** Allows creating new objects by copying an existing one, avoiding the need to create objects from scratch.

***`Singleton:`*** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

***`Strategy:`*** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

***`Chain of Responsibility:`*** Decouples sender and receiver by allowing multiple objects to handle a request.

***`Template Method:`*** Defines the structure of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps.

***`Command:`*** Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests.

***`Observer:`*** Defines a dependency between objects, ensuring that changes in one object trigger updates in dependent objects.

***`Bridge:`*** Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.

***`Decorator:`*** Dynamically adds behavior to an object without altering its structure.
